# â˜• Monday Coffee Expansion Analysis

## Overview

**Monday Coffee**, an online coffee retailer, is planning to expand its operations by opening physical coffee shops in three of India's top cities. Since its launch in **January 2023**, the company has seen strong online sales and positive customer feedback across multiple cities. As a Data Analyst, your role is to analyze the sales data and recommend the top three cities for expansion based on data-driven insights.

This project uses SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the available datasets and generate business recommendations.

## Objective

The goal of this analysis is to identify **the top three cities** where Monday Coffee should open new stores. The recommendations are based on factors such as:

- Total sales and customer behavior
- City population and estimated coffee consumers
- Average sales per customer
- Estimated rent and cost-efficiency
- Market potential and growth trends

## Dataset Details

The analysis uses the following tables:

- `city` â€“ City-level data including population, estimated rent, and ranking
- `customers` â€“ Customer demographic and location information
- `sales` â€“ Transaction-level data of purchases
- `products` â€“ Coffee products with product IDs and names
